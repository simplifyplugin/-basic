## MySQL Concepts and Tricky Queries with Real-Life Examples

### 1. **Indexes**

**Concept:**
Indexes speed up data retrieval by creating a structure that improves search efficiency. Imagine an index in a book that helps you quickly find a topic.

**Types:**
- **Primary Index:** Like a book’s index page; ensures each entry is unique.
- **Unique Index:** Ensures no duplicate values, similar to a social security number.
- **Composite Index:** Combines multiple columns for faster searches, like indexing multiple criteria in a form.
- **Full-Text Index:** Used for searching text, like finding specific words in a document.

**Example Query:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees (name);
```

### 2. **Joins**

**Concept:**
Joins are like combining data from different sources, similar to creating a detailed report by combining data from multiple spreadsheets.

**Types:**
- **INNER JOIN:** Matches records from both tables, like merging two lists of contacts who have both subscribed and purchased.
- **LEFT JOIN:** Includes all records from the left table and matched records from the right table, similar to listing all customers (even those who haven’t made purchases yet) and their purchase records.
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Includes all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN:** Returns all records from both tables (not directly supported in MySQL).

**Example Query:**
```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

### 3. **Subqueries**

**Concept:**
Subqueries are like checking a reference within a larger report. They let you use the result of one query inside another query.

**Types:**
- **Scalar Subquery:** Returns a single value, like finding the average salary of employees in a specific department.
- **Row Subquery:** Returns a single row, like fetching details of an employee based on their ID.
- **Table Subquery:** Returns a table, like listing all employees who earn more than the average salary.

**Example Query:**
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

### 4. **Transactions**

**Concept:**
Transactions are like multi-step processes that need to be completed fully or not at all, similar to booking a flight where the payment must go through before the ticket is issued.

**Commands:**
- **START TRANSACTION:** Begins a transaction.
- **COMMIT:** Finalizes the transaction.
- **ROLLBACK:** Reverts changes if something goes wrong.

**Example Query:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

### 5. **Stored Procedures**

**Concept:**
Stored procedures are like recipes that you can follow multiple times. They are pre-defined sets of SQL statements.

**Example Query:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails(IN employee_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = employee_id;
END;
```

### 6. **Triggers**

**Concept:**
Triggers are like automatic notifications sent when certain events happen, similar to getting an alert when a new email arrives.

**Example Query:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_salary
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO salary_changes (employee_id, old_salary, new_salary, change_date)
    VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary, NOW());
END;
```

### 7. **Views**

**Concept:**
Views are like custom reports that you can create from your data. They provide a simplified or restricted view of the data.

**Example Query:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT name, email
FROM customers
WHERE status = 'Active';
```

### 8. **Normalization**

**Concept:**
Normalization is like organizing a filing cabinet so that related documents are grouped together to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.

**Forms:**
- **First Normal Form (1NF):** Each column holds unique data.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF):** All data is fully dependent on the primary key.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF):** Data is dependent only on the primary key, not on other columns.

### 9. **Data Aggregation**

**Concept:**
Data aggregation is like summarizing survey results, where you calculate totals, averages, or other summary metrics.

**Example Query:**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### 10. **Complex Queries**

**Concept:**
Complex queries involve multiple operations and conditions, like combining data from various sources and performing calculations in a single report.

**Tricky Query Examples:**

**Finding Duplicate Records:**
```sql
SELECT email, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Finding the Top N Records:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Using Subqueries for Updates:**
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales')
WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

**Self-Join Example:**
```sql
SELECT a.name AS Manager, b.name AS Employee
FROM employees a
INNER JOIN employees b ON a.id = b.manager_id
WHERE a.department = 'HR';
```


## MySQL Differences: Interview Questions

| **Concept**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Example Query**                                                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN** | **INNER JOIN** returns rows with matching values in both tables. **LEFT JOIN** returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table. Non-matching rows from the right table will be NULL. | `SELECT a.*, b.* FROM table1 a INNER JOIN table2 b ON a.id = b.id;`<br>`SELECT a.*, b.* FROM table1 a LEFT JOIN table2 b ON a.id = b.id;` |
| **UNION vs UNION ALL** | **UNION** removes duplicate rows between the result sets. **UNION ALL** returns all rows, including duplicates.                                                                                                                             | `SELECT column1 FROM table1 UNION SELECT column1 FROM table2;`<br>`SELECT column1 FROM table1 UNION ALL SELECT column1 FROM table2;`  |
| **PRIMARY KEY vs UNIQUE KEY** | **PRIMARY KEY** uniquely identifies each record and does not allow NULL values. **UNIQUE KEY** also ensures uniqueness but allows a single NULL value.                                                                                          | `CREATE TABLE table_name (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE);` |
| **AUTO_INCREMENT vs SERIAL** | **AUTO_INCREMENT** is used to automatically increment a column value, typically for primary keys. **SERIAL** is a shorthand that creates an integer column with auto-increment behavior and a unique constraint.                              | `CREATE TABLE table_name (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));`<br>`CREATE TABLE table_name (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));` |
| **HAVING vs WHERE**   | **WHERE** filters records before grouping. **HAVING** filters records after grouping.                                                                                                                                                           | `SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`<br>`SELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`  |
| **TRIGGERS vs STORED PROCEDURES** | **TRIGGERS** are automatic actions performed in response to table events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). **STORED PROCEDURES** are precompiled SQL statements that can be executed with specific inputs.                                 | `CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name BEFORE INSERT ON table_name FOR EACH ROW BEGIN -- trigger logic; END;`<br>`CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (IN param datatype) BEGIN -- procedure logic; END;` |
| **VIEW vs TEMPORARY TABLE** | **VIEW** is a virtual table based on a SELECT query, used for simplifying complex queries and providing security. **TEMPORARY TABLE** is a physical table used to store data temporarily during a session.                                            | `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table_name;`<br>`CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table AS SELECT * FROM table_name;`  |
| **VARCHAR vs CHAR**   | **VARCHAR** is a variable-length string. **CHAR** is a fixed-length string. VARCHAR saves space by using only the necessary amount of space, while CHAR pads the remaining space with spaces.                                           | `CREATE TABLE table_name (varchar_col VARCHAR(255), char_col CHAR(10));` |
| **OLAP vs OLTP**      | **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** is designed for complex queries and analysis, often in data warehouses. **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** is designed for transaction-oriented tasks with quick query processing.            | `OLAP: SELECT SUM(sales) FROM sales_table WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';`<br>`OLTP: INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, amount) VALUES (1, 1001, 250);`  |
| **FULLTEXT vs REGULAR INDEX** | **FULLTEXT INDEX** is used for full-text searches. **REGULAR INDEX** is used for basic data retrieval and sorting.                                                                                                                          | `CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ft_index ON table_name (column_name);`<br>`CREATE INDEX reg_index ON table_name (column_name);`  |
